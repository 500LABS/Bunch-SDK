## 1.Deeplink URL Scheme
Please provide the deeplink scheme your application is registered to

## 2.URL Scheme supported params
Please provide desired deeplink output coming from us.

### We can provide 3 different parameters to the deeplink url:

### and we can fit them however you like into your deeplink URL:

We will make the conversion on our server to fit your custom scheme whichever way you prefer:
